I'm glad you are here.

This home is under construction.

I would like to share my perspective. I prefer certain hardware. Let me tell you why I fly a Phantom 4 Pro
<hr>
You may find other pilots who use a Mavic 2 Pro. It is a newer drone. 
<hr>
It has a 10-bit color profile and high portability. It is also smaller.  
<hr>
You see DJI is just like the railroad I work for. Their purpose is to make more money at less cost. 
<hr>
You see the Mavic weighs less than the Phantom 4 Pro.  What this means the parts can all be smaller. 
<hr>
Batteries are smaller, motors are smaller, even the camera sensor is smaller. The Phantom 4 Pro is bigger. It is more stable.
<hr>
It can shoot 60 fps at 4k. The Mavic2 can only shoot 30 fps at 4k. 
<hr>
The Phantom 4 Pro also has a mechanical shutter that is better for mapping. 
<hr>
The digital shutter of the Mavic 2 Pro can cause the dreaded rolling shutter effect. 
<hr>
If you are willing to make the convenience sacrifice, Phantom 4 Pro is better all around. 
<hr>
If you can still get it.
