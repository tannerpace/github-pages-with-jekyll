Why bigger is better, keeping a low overhead, on your drone mapping business helps you offer your services at a competitive rate.Flying High and capturing multiple exposures is best when it comes to landscape photography. This is in contrast to getting a high resolution for orthomatic maps and 3d models.Drones are the best tool to create variable rate application maps. You may find other pilots who use a Mavic 2 Pro. It is a newer drone.It has a 10-bit color profile and high portability. It is also smaller. It is not better.
You see DJI is just like most big coporations. Their purpose is to make more money at less cost. 
You see the Mavic weighs less than the Phantom 4 Pro.  What this means the parts can all be smaller. 
Batteries are smaller, motors are smaller, even the camera sensor is smaller. The Phantom 4 Pro is bigger. It is more stable.
It can shoot 60 fps at 4k. The Mavic2 can only shoot 30 fps at 4k. 
The Phantom 4 Pro also has a mechanical shutter that is better for mapping. 
The digital shutter of the Mavic 2 Pro can cause the dreaded rolling shutter effect. 
If you are willing to make the convenience sacrifice, Phantom 4 Pro is better all around.
