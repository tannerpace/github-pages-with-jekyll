# Why I fly A Phantom 4 pro.

I'm glad you are here. I plan to teach you what I have learned through my experiences as a drone pilot, reasons I chose certain hardware/software. First let me tell you why I fly a Phantom 4 pro as aposed to a mavic 2 pro which is a more recent addition to the dji line up. You see dji is just like the railroad I work for.. There motive is to make more product with less cost. We will call that operating ratio.
