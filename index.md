# I picked the older drone...

I'm glad you asked... I plan to teach you what I have learned through my experiences as a drone pilot, and share my perspective from a a freight train engineer/conductor stand point. reasons I chose certain hardware/software. First let me tell you why I fly a Phantom 4 pro as aposed to a mavic 2 pro which is a more recent addition to the dji line up. You see dji is just like the railroad I work for.. Thier motive is to make more product with less cost. We will call that operating ratio. You see the mavic weighs less than the phantom 4 pro... this means the parts can all be smaller. Batteries arent cheap! Neither are motors and speed controllers.
