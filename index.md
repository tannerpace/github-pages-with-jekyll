I would like to share my perspective. I prefer certain hardware. Let me tell you why I fly a Phantom 4 Pro, instead of a Mavic 2 pro.  You may find other pilots who use a Mavic 2 Pro. It is a newer drone. It has a 10-bit color profile and high portability. It is also smaller.  You see DJI is just like the railroad I work for. Their purpose is to make more money at less cost.  You see the Mavic weighs less than the Phantom 4 Pro.  What this means the parts can all be smaller. Batteries are smaller, motors are smaller, even the camera sensor is smaller. The Phantom 4 Pro is bigger. It is more stable. It can shoot 60 fps at 4k. The Mavic2 can only shoot 30 fps at 4k. The Phantom 4 Pro also has a mechanical shutter that is better for mapping. The digital shutter of the Mavic 2 Pro can cause the dreaded rolling shutter effect. Mechanical Shutter
